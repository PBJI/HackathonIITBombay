# Data Science
## Introduction
Financial institutions will process and keep a massive volume of consumer
documents. These documents are crucial to the company's operations, and there
are statutory obligations on how they must be processed and stored. To identify
the documents and extract data from them, a significant amount of human
processing is required.
## Problem Statement
1) Based on the input file, the documents must be identified, classified, and divided
into multiple groups. The user can submit a single file (image/pdf/word document)
that contains many documents. Create a library that accepts a user supplied file and
recognises and splits numerous documents existing in the file.
Documents to be classified and split are:
• PAN
• Aadhaar (Aadhaar front, Aadhaar back)
• Bank Statement
• ITR/Form 16
• Customer Photograph (Selfie)
• Utility Bill (Power, Water, Gas, Landline etc)
• Cheque Leaf
• Salary Slip/Certificate
• Driving License
• Voter ID
• Passport
2) Once document is classified and split, create a library which accepts split
document and extracts the data from it.

The library built should be scalable and secure to process millions of files.

## Note
The first problem statement carries more weightage. If all or most of the documents
in problem statement 1 have been addressed, go on to solve problem statement 2

## Guidelines For Submission
● The participants have to prepare a report consisting of 2-3 pages covering
which all documents your library is able to identify and extract data ●
